Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the digital world, where I take data on adventures and turn it into engaging stories. I'm your friendly neighborhood business analyst, on a mission to make sense of numbers and weave them into captivating visual tales.

🔭 Right now, I'm developing a dynamic database website with SQL, AWS and Linux (Nginx), handling unstructured web scraped data to measure and rank the economic well-being of U.S. counties at a granular level.

🌱 I'm also levelling up my skills with fancy machine learning models, ready to tackle even bigger data challenges.

📫 You can catch me hanging out on Discord @fakefunkytown

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not decoding data, I'm all about painting up a storm and tuning into some seriously interesting podcasts. Want to know what masterpiece I'm working on or the latest podcast obsession? Just ask!

Let's team up and add a touch of human magic to the world of data, one colorful visualization at a time! 🎨🎙️
